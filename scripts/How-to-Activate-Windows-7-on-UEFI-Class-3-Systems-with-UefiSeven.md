# How to Activate Windows 7 on UEFI Class 3 Systems with UefiSeven
 
Windows 7 is one of the most popular operating systems in the world, but it has a major drawback: it does not fully support UEFI, the modern firmware interface that replaces the legacy BIOS. UEFI offers many advantages over BIOS, such as faster boot times, better security, and compatibility with newer hardware. However, Windows 7 relies on legacy BIOS interrupt 10 (Int10h) during initial graphics initialization, which is not available on UEFI Class 3 systems that do not have any legacy support. This means that Windows 7 might freeze on the 'Starting Windows' screen or fail with error code 0xc000000d when trying to boot on such systems.

Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem: UefiSeven. UefiSeven is an EFI module that enables Windows 7 to boot under UEFI Class 3 systems by installing a minimal Int10h handler in the memory before Windows boots up. This way, Windows 7 can access the graphics card and display the boot logo and the login screen without any issues. UefiSeven also contains a hack to enable screen output on hardwares that do not natively support 1024x768 resolution, which is needed by Windows Installer.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use UefiSeven to activate Windows 7 on UEFI Class 3 systems without using any crack or loader. This method is legal and does not violate any license agreement or warranty. However, you will need a valid product key for Windows 7 and a USB drive with at least 4 GB of space.
 
## Step 1: Prepare Windows 7 Installation USB Drive
 
The first step is to create a bootable USB drive with Windows 7 installation files. You can use any tool that can create a bootable USB drive from an ISO file, such as Rufus or UNetbootin. Alternatively, you can use the official Windows USB/DVD Download Tool from Microsoft.
 
Once you have created the bootable USB drive, you need to rename the file `bootx64.efi` at `(UsbDrive)\EFI\Boot\` to `bootx64.original.efi`. This file is the original EFI bootloader for Windows 7 that does not work on UEFI Class 3 systems.
 
Next, you need to download UefiSeven from its GitHub page[^1^] and unpack it. You will find a file called `bootx64.efi` inside the archive. This file is the modified EFI bootloader for Windows 7 that works on UEFI Class 3 systems. Copy this file to `(UsbDrive)\EFI\Boot\`, replacing the original file.
 
## Step 2: Install Windows 7 on UEFI Class 3 System
 
The next step is to install Windows 7 on your UEFI Class 3 system using the USB drive you prepared in the previous step. To do this, you need to boot from the USB drive by changing the boot order in your UEFI settings or by using a boot menu key (usually F12 or Esc).
 
Once you boot from the USB drive, you will see the Windows logo and then the language selection screen. Choose your language and click Next. Then click Install Now and enter your product key when prompted. Accept the license terms and choose Custom (advanced) as the installation type.
 
On the next screen, you will see a list of partitions on your hard drive. You need to delete all existing partitions and create a new one for Windows 7. To do this, select each partition and click Delete until you have only unallocated space left. Then click New and enter the size of your desired partition (at least 20 GB). Click Apply and then OK to confirm.
 
You will see a warning message saying that Windows might create additional partitions for system files. Click OK
